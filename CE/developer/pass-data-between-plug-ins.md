[!INCLUDE[](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

The message pipeline model for [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] apps defines a parameter collection of custom data values in the execution context that is passed through the pipeline and shared among registered plug-ins, even from different 3rd party developers. This collection of data can be used by different plug-ins to communicate information between plug-ins and enable chain processing where data processed by one plug-in can be processed by the next plug-in in the sequence and so on. This feature is especially useful in pricing engine scenarios where multiple pricing plug-ins pass data between one another to calculate the total price for a sales order or invoice. Another potential use for this feature is to communicate information between a plug-in registered for a pre-event and a plug-in registered for a post-event.  
  
 The name of the parameter that is used for passing information between plug-ins is <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IExecutionContext.SharedVariables>. This is a collection of key\value pairs. At run time, plug-ins can add, read, or modify properties in the **SharedVariables** collection. This provides a method of information communication among plug-ins.  

 Download the sample: [Work with plug-ins](https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/Sample-Create-a-basic-plug-64d86ade).
  
 This sample shows how to use **SharedVariables** to pass data from a pre-event registered plug-in to a post-event registered plug-in.  
  
 [!code-csharp[Plug-ins#SharedVariablesPlugin](../snippets/csharp/CRMV8/plug-ins/cs/sharedvariablesplugin.cs#sharedvariablesplugin)]  
  
 It is important that any type of data added to the shared variables collection be serializable otherwise the server will not know how to serialize the data and plug-in execution will fail.  
  
 For a plug-in registered in stage 20 or 40, to access the shared variables from a stage 10 registered plug-in that executes on create, update, delete, or by a <xref:Microsoft.Crm.Sdk.Messages.RetrieveExchangeRateRequest>, you must access the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IPluginExecutionContext.ParentContext>.**SharedVariables** collection. For all other cases, <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IPluginExecutionContext>.**SharedVariables** contains the collection.
