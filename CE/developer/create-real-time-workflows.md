title: Create real-time workflows (Developer Guide for Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps) | MicrosoftDocs
description: Learn about real-time workflows that can be used to model and automate real world business processes. Real-time workflows are for business users, for example business analysts, to implement similar functionality to synchronous plug-ins without requiring .NET Framework programming experience.
