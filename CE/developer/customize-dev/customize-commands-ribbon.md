title: Customize commands and the ribbon (Developer Guide for Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement) | MicrosoftDocs
description: 'Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement displays commands in different ways depending on the entity and the client. In most places in the web application you will see a command bar instead of a ribbon. Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement for tablets also uses data defined as ribbons to control what commands are available using a command bar that is optimized for touch. '
