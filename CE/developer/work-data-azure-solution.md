title: Work with Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement data in your Azure solution (Developer Guide for Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps) | MicrosoftDocs
description: The ServiceBusPlugin plug-in contains the business logic to post the Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement message execution context to the Azure Service Bus. To use this plug-in, you need to register a Azure Service Bus solution endpoint and a step for the plug-in. The step defines what message and entity combination being processed by the core Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement operation should trigger the plug-in to execute. The ServiceBusPlugin can only be registered to run asynchronously.
