 <!--If your app is a good fit, please proceed to the next step to submit your app. The specific process for this may change over time, but at the time this was written the process consists of a form where you will let us know about your app and how to contact you. After that, someone will contact you and help lead you through the process of registering your app.  
  
   
  
 When potential customers click on the listing for your app on AppSource there are different experiences they may have depending on how your app is registered. There are three submission types: *hosted*, *partner-led* and *customer-led*.  
  
-   A *hosted trial* will display a link to allow an interested customer to try your application in a separate hosted environment.  
  
-   A *partner-led trial* is essentially a lead-referral program where the AppSource site will forward information to you about a someone who is interested in your app. A partner led trial is a good choice when your app has solutions with dependencies or is not installed as a [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] apps solution.  
  
-   A *customer-led trial* is where the customer will have the opportunity to install your application into their [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm_online](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm-online.md)] apps organization.  
  
## Certification process for customer-led trial offer  
 The customer-led trial offer has the most rigorous certification process. For a customer-led trial you will need to create a [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] apps Package. A [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] apps package is a setup package for deploying [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] apps solutions, data and executing install and upgrade operations on an instance of [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] apps. This allows for the automation of installation tasks to support deploying an application into the customer's [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] apps environment. Creating [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] apps packages is identical to creating packages for the [!INCLUDE[pn_package_deployer_long](../includes/pn-package-deployer-long.md)] with a few additional steps. More information: [Create packages for the CRM Package Deployer](create-packages-package-deployer.md)  
  
 When submitting a [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] apps Package for a customer-led trial please be aware of the following:  
  
-   Your [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] apps Package will be tested to make sure that it only uses supported extensibility methods as documented in the [!INCLUDE [pn-sdk](../includes/pn-sdk.md)].  
  
-   With your [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] apps Package you will need to provide a number of test cases and use cases which will be reviewed as part of the certification process.-->
