title: Metadata and data models (Developer Guide for Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps) | MicrosoftDocs
description: Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps uses a metadata driven architecture to provide the flexibility to create custom entities and additional system entity attributes. This structure also makes upgrades and the transportation of customizations easier. The data structure can change without requiring any change to code in the Customer Engagement server or client applications.
