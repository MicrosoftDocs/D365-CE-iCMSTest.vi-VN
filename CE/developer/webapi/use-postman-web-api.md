# <a name="use-postman-with-web-api"></a>Use Postman with Web API

There are number of third-party request composer tools that allow you to authenticate to [!INCLUDE[](../../includes/pn-dyn-365.md)] for Customer Engagement apps instances, compose Web API requests, send them, and view responses. Postman is one of the most popular.

Use Postman to try ad-hoc queries or verify the behavior of operations without writing a program. This section covers information on how to configure a Postman environment that connects to your [!INCLUDE[](../../includes/pn-dyn-365.md)] for Customer Engagement apps instance and use Postman to perform operations with Web API.

Postman offers many other capabilities beyond those covered in this content. More information: [First 5 things to try if youâ€™re new to Postman](http://blog.getpostman.com/2018/04/11/first-5-things-to-try-if-youre-new-to-postman/)
