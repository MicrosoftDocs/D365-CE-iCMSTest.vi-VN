title: Impersonation in plug-ins (Developer Guide for Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps) | MicrosoftDocs
description: Impersonation is used to execute business logic (custom code) on behalf of a system user to provide a desired feature or service for that user. Any business logic executed within a plug-in, including Web service method calls and data access, is governed by the security privileges of the impersonated user.
