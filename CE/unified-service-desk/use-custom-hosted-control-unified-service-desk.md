# <a name="use-custom-hosted-control-in-unified-service-desk"></a>Use custom hosted control in Unified Service Desk
You can develop custom [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] hosted controls if you have a special requirement that isn’t addressed by the predefined hosted control types. [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] apps provides a [!INCLUDE[pn_Visual_Studio_short](../includes/pn-visual-studio-short.md)] template for creating a custom [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] hosted control. Các mẫu cung cấp mã cơ bản như nhận xét để giúp bạn bắt đầu nhanh với việc tạo kiểm soát tổ chức tùy chỉnh.  
  
 Like the predefined hosted controls, custom [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] hosted controls are also derived from the [DynamicsBaseHostedControl](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.crm.unifiedservicedesk.dynamics.dynamicsbasehostedcontrol) class.
