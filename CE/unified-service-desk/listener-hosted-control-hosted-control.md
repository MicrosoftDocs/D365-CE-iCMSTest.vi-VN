# <a name="listener-hosted-control-hosted-control"></a>Listener Hosted Control (Hosted Control)
Use the `Listener Hosted Control` type of hosted control, introduced in [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk_20](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk-20.md)], to configure a custom listener for your auditing, diagnostic, and trace logs. The hosted control contains a reference to your assembly and class that contains the code for the custom listener. This type of hosted control doesn’t have any predefined UII actions or events.  
  
 For information about creating and using a `Listener Hosted Control` type of hosted control, see [Use custom listeners for auditing, diagnostics and traces](../unified-service-desk/create-custom-listeners-auditing-diagnostics-traces.md)
