# <a name="unified-service-desk-and-the-uii-framework"></a>Unified Service Desk and the UII framework
[!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk_for_crm](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk-for-crm.md)] is developed using the [!INCLUDE[pn_user_inteface_integration_uii](../includes/pn-user-interface-integration-uii.md)] framework. [!INCLUDE[pn_uii_acronym](../includes/pn-uii-acronym.md)] provides a development framework for building integrated agent applications that provide unified access to customer information across different systems and aggregate different modes of customer interactions or channels. This section provides you information about the UII concepts and components that are required for extending the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] beyond its core capabilities. If you’re interested in learning in-depth about the UII framework, [download](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=519179) the UII SDK, and read the UII documentation.  
  
 After reading this section, you’ll be able to use the [!INCLUDE[pn_uii_acronym](../includes/pn-uii-acronym.md)] components to extend [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk.md)] such as integrate with external applications, web applications, and [!INCLUDE[pn_computer_telephony_integration_cti](../includes/pn-computer-telephony-integration-cti.md)] systems.
