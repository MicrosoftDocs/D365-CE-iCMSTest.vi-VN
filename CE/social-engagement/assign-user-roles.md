# <a name="assign-permissions-and-user-roles"></a>Assign permissions and user roles
Manage user permissions by assigning user roles for newly licensed users and editing user roles for existing users. Learn how to contact licensed users by email in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_long](../includes/pn-social-engagement-long.md)].  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You must be a [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] Administrator to perform these tasks.  
  
<a name="AssignRole"></a>   
## <a name="assign-a-role-to-a-new-user"></a>Assign a role to a new user  
  
1.  Navigate to **Settings** > **User Management**.  
  
2.  In the **Users** pane, select **Newly invited** from the **Configuration role** drop-down menu.  
  
3.  Select the check boxes for the users you want to assign a role to and click the **Edit** ![Edit button](media/edit-icon.png "Edit button") button.  
  
4.  In the **Edit User Role** pane, select the user roles from the drop-down menus.  
  
5.  To confirm your assignment, click **Save** ![Save button](media/save-icon.png "Save button").  
  
<a name="ChangeRole"></a>   
## <a name="change-a-role-for-a-user"></a>Change a role for a user  
  
1.  Navigate to **Settings** > **User Management**.  
  
2.  In the **Users** pane, select the list entry you want to edit.  
  
3.  In the **Edit User Role** dialog box, select the user role from the drop-down menus.  
  
4.  Click **Save** ![Save button](media/save-icon.png "Save button").  
  
> [!TIP]
>  You can use the **Search for users** input field to find licensed users of your [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)] solution. Additionally, you can filter for users with a specific role by choosing a role in the **Configuration role** or **Interaction role** drop-down list.  
> 
> [!NOTE]
>  The specified user will receive an email with the updated user roles and permissions.  
> 
>  Bulk editing user roles is limited to newly invited users.  
> 
>  Users that are listed as Delegated Administrator always have Administrator and Manager user roles in [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_short](../includes/pn-social-engagement-short.md)]. A lock icon ![Lock button](media/lock-icon.png "Lock button") next to the user’s name indicates that you can’t change the permissions.

## <a name="send-email-to-users"></a>Send email to users  
Use your email client to send email to [!INCLUDE[pn_netbreeze_long](../includes/pn-social-engagement-long.md)] users. You don’t need to research a user’s email address. The email opens with the recipient’s address already filled in.  
  
1.  Navigate to **Settings** > **User Management**.  
  
2.  Identify the user you want to contact and click the **Email** ![Send message button in Social Engagement](media/enevelope-icon.png "Send message button in Social Engagement") button in the **Users** list.
